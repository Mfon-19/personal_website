# Hello World!

Hello world!

So I finally made a blog, after procrastinating for months. Writing is something I did a lot back in high school, mostly because writing was part of the IB curriculum. Writing papers in science and math classes, essays in literature and TOK class, and writing for assignments. Lots of writing…. In my first year of university, I wrote a bit for my English classes, but past that, I barely wrote anything, only consumed. Technical blogs, news articles, textbooks, twitter posts, etc., I’ve been consuming a lot, but not producing. People say it is good to produce, even moral, but my motivation for resuming is purely selfish. 

When I am stuck on some concept or problem while studying, like many others, I open ChatGPT and ask it a question. I write a message in the textbox, which forces me to think about what it is I am stuck on. I try my best to fully brain dump my understanding of the problem I’m trying to solve or the concept I'm struggling to grasp. Typically, the process of thinking and writing leads me to the solution, and I don't need ChatGPT. Writing forces me to take a proper look at my conceptions of things and, since I think, I find flaws in my reasoning or reach an epiphany here and there. I want to reap these benefits of writing to the fullest in 2026, which is why I've decided that I'll write a blog post every single week this year. Now the question is, what do I write? 

I ‘locked in’ a few months before I got my first co-op. I learned fullstack development, and built a few projects which landed me the role. While at the role, after work each day, I studied distributed systems using the MIT course, and read a lot of papers. In December, I decided to get good at systems engineering/infra/distributed systems. Knowing that my background in operating systems was a bit weak, I started reading cs:app with the next goal being taking the MIT operating systems course. I like my progress so far, but what has bothered me is that I don't write enough code. I hear people say that to get good at things, you need theory and lots of practice. Well, I've been consuming a lot of theory, but haven’t applied it in code. This is one of my goals for 2026. I need to get good at systems/infra/distributed systems, and that needs a ton of theory, but even more code. So I'm thinking, as I learn theory and write code that applies that theory, I should write about that to cement my understanding of concepts. Since I've decided to write every week, this should force me to write more code so that I have something to write about at the end of the week.

I’m happy and excited about these goals. I’m not working a part time job, and I have quite a bit of free time so I should be able to devote 12 hours a day. The only thing I'm worried about is that I don't have an internship secured for summer 2026. pain….

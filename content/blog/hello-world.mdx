# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts, learnings, and experiences here.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Tech Projects** - Deep dives into things I'm building
- **Learning Journey** - New technologies and concepts I'm exploring
- **Career Reflections** - Lessons learned as a CS student

## Why Blog?

Writing helps me solidify my understanding of topics and hopefully helps others who are on a similar journey. Plus, it's a great way to document my growth over time.

```javascript
// Here's a quick code example
const greeting = "Thanks for reading!";
console.log(greeting);
```

Stay tuned for more posts! 🚀
